      "\n",
      "3x more tokens.\n",
      "By reducing our memory footprint, we‚Äôre able to ingest many more tokens and more dynamically than before. A single L4 (24GB) can handle 30k tokens on llama 3.1-8B, while vLLM gets barely 10k. A lot of work went into reducing the footprint of the runtime and its effect are best seen on smaller constrained environments.\n",

      "13x faster\n",
      "On long prompts (200k+ tokens) conversation replies take 27.5s in vLLM, while it takes only 2s in TGI. How so ? We keep the initial conversation around, so when a new reply comes in, we can answer almost instantly. The overhead of the lookup is ~5us. Thanks @Dani√´l de Kok for the beast data structure.\n",

We kept all existing flags around, they may come in handy in niche scenarios.\n",
